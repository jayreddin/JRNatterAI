# Multi Model Mode for AI Chat Interface Development Plan

## Overview
Enables users to select, add, remove, and rearrange multiple AI models in the chat interface, sending a single message to all selected models and viewing their responses in a structured, side-by-side layout. Model selections and chat history can be restored from the chat history popup. The interface is responsive and adapts to both desktop and mobile devices.

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize project repository (if not already done)
  - Set up version control (Git)
  - Add `.gitignore` for node_modules, build artifacts, etc.
- [ ] Configure development environment
  - Install required tools (Node.js, npm/yarn, code editor)
  - Set up code formatting and linting (Prettier, ESLint)
- [ ] Database setup (if chat history is persisted server-side)
  - Choose database technology (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB, Postgres)
  - Create initial schema for chat sessions, messages, and model selections
- [ ] Project scaffolding
  - Organize frontend and backend directories
  - Set up basic file structure for components, services, and utilities

## 2. Backend Foundation
- [ ] Define database models and migrations
  - Chat session, message, and model selection entities
- [ ] Implement authentication system
  - User sign-in/sign-up (if not already present)
  - Session management
- [ ] Core services and utilities
  - Service for managing chat sessions and model selections
  - Utility for handling simultaneous requests to multiple AI models
- [ ] Base API structure
  - REST or GraphQL endpoints for chat, model management, and history

## 3. Feature-specific Backend
- [ ] API endpoints for Multi Model Mode
  - Endpoint to send a message to multiple models and return all responses
  - Endpoint to save and retrieve chat history with model selections
  - Endpoint to restore previous sessions (conversation + model chips)
- [ ] Business logic implementation
  - Logic to prevent duplicate model selection
  - Logic to handle unlimited model selections efficiently
  - Logic to warn when all models are selected
- [ ] Data validation and processing
  - Validate model selections and user input
  - Sanitize and process chat messages
- [ ] Integration with external AI model APIs
  - Support for all available models (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, etc.)

## 4. Frontend Foundation
- [ ] UI framework setup (e.g., React, Vue, or Vanilla JS)
- [ ] Component library and design system
  - Define reusable components (dropdown, chip, modal, grid, etc.)
- [ ] Routing system (if multi-page)
- [ ] State management
  - Manage selected models, chat history, and UI state
- [ ] Authentication UI
  - Sign-in/sign-up forms and user state display

## 5. Feature-specific Frontend
- [ ] Multi Model Mode toggle in header
  - Switch to enable/disable Multi mode
- [ ] Dynamic model selection UI
  - Empty dropdown and round "+" button when Multi mode is enabled
  - Add model as chip with red X for removal
  - Grey out already-selected models in dropdowns
  - Allow unlimited model selections (add new dropdowns as needed)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop rearrangement of model chips
  - Implement drag-and-drop for chips in the header
  - Update order in state and reflect in chat grid
- [ ] Responsive chat grid layout
  - Display model responses in a 3-column grid (desktop)
  - Center last row if not full
  - Adapt to 2 columns on mobile
- [ ] Modal popup for excessive model selection
  - Show warning when all models are selected, with dismiss button
- [ ] Restore model selections and conversation from chat history popup
  - List previous sessions with model selections
  - Allow user to restore both conversation and model chips
- [ ] Error handling and feedback
  - Handle API errors, invalid selections, and UI edge cases

## 6. Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend model selection UI to backend API
- [ ] Ensure chat messages are sent to all selected models in parallel
- [ ] Display responses in the correct order and layout
- [ ] Sync chat history and model selections between frontend and backend

## 7. Testing
- [ ] Unit testing
  - Backend: API endpoints, business logic, data validation
  - Frontend: UI components, state management
- [ ] Integration testing
  - End-to-end tests for multi-model chat flow
  - Test drag-and-drop, model addition/removal, and restoration from history
- [ ] End-to-end testing
  - Simulate real user flows (enable Multi mode, add/remove/rearrange models, send messages, restore sessions)
- [ ] Performance testing
  - Test UI and backend performance with many models selected
- [ ] Security testing
  - Ensure only authenticated users can access their chat history and model selections

## 8. Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
  - Document all backend endpoints and data contracts
- [ ] User guides
  - How to use Multi Model Mode, add/remove/rearrange models, restore sessions
- [ ] Developer documentation
  - Code structure, key components, and extension points
- [ ] System architecture documentation
  - Overview of frontend-backend integration and data flow

## 9. Deployment
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
  - Automated build, test, and deployment scripts
- [ ] Staging environment
  - Deploy for internal testing and QA
- [ ] Production environment
  - Final deployment and go-live
- [ ] Monitoring setup
  - Track errors, performance, and usage

## 10. Maintenance
- [ ] Bug fixing procedures
  - Triage, prioritize, and resolve issues
- [ ] Update processes
  - Regularly update dependencies and libraries
- [ ] Backup strategies
  - Ensure chat history and user data are backed up (if server-side)
- [ ] Performance monitoring
  - Ongoing monitoring and optimization of UI and backend
