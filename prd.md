# PRD: Multi Model Mode for AI Chat Interface

## 1. Product overview
### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: Multi Model Mode for AI Chat Interface
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary
The Multi Model Mode feature enables users to select and interact with multiple AI language models simultaneously within the chat interface. Users can dynamically add, remove, and rearrange models, sending a single message to all selected models and viewing their responses in a structured, side-by-side layout. This feature is designed to enhance comparison, experimentation, and productivity for users who wish to leverage the strengths of different AI models in parallel.

The interface adapts to both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across platforms. Model selections and chat history are preserved and can be restored from the chat history popup, supporting efficient workflow continuity.

## 2. Goals

## 6. Narrative
Jamie is a power user who wants to compare the outputs of several AI models at once to choose the best response for a complex question. She enables Multi mode, adds her preferred models, and sends a single message. The responses appear side by side, making it easy to compare and analyze. Later, she restores a previous session from chat history, instantly bringing back her model selections and conversation, saving time and effort.
